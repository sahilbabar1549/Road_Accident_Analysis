## Road Accident Analysis  
This project features an interactive dashboard built with Microsoft Power BI to analyze road accident data from the years 2021 and 2022. The dashboard provides an in-depth overview of total accidents and casualties, accident severity, and year-on-year (YoY) trends. It also uncovers insights based on road types, geographical areas, time of day, weather conditions, and road surfaces where these incidents occurred.

## Project Highlights
Designed a dynamic Power BI dashboard comparing road accident data between 2021 (previous year) and 2022 (current year).
Integrated advanced filters, slicers, and drill-down capabilities to support user-driven analysis.
Conducted data cleaning, transformation, and established data relationships to develop a robust data model.
Created custom measures and calculated columns using DAX to derive YoY changes, YTD metrics, and category-wise aggregations.
Utilized a range of visualizations, including:
Area charts

Donut charts

Stacked bar charts

Geo-location maps

Image imports

Map slicers (e.g., weather conditions and road surface types)

## Primary KPIs
Total Casualties and Total Accidents (2022 vs 2021)
Casualties by Accident Severity with YoY growth
Casualties by Vehicle Type (2022)
## Key Insights
Primary stakeholders include the Ministry of Transport, Road Transport Department, Police, Emergency Services, Traffic Management Agencies, Media, and the Public.
Casualties decreased by 11.9% in 2022 compared to 2021.
Accidents dropped by 11.7%, with 114.4K incidents reported in 2022.

Reductions observed in:

Fatal casualties: 33.3%

Serious casualties: 16.2%

Slight casualties: 10.6%

This improvement suggests better traffic management, infrastructure upgrades, and increased public awareness.
Cars and vans were involved in the highest number of casualties, followed by motorcycles.
Winter months saw more casualties, primarily due to snowy weather and slippery road surfaces.
Urban areas and daytime hours recorded higher accident rates due to dense traffic, unlike rural zones and nighttime hours.
Area-wise casualty distribution can be explored through the interactive map chart in the dashboard.
